Abstract:
This retail analytics study uses transaction data to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) and identify loyal customers. By analyzing purchase frequency and amount, the report offers insights to improve customer retention, optimize product assortments, and allocate resources across different store types. Visualization tools are used to present actionable findings for retail businesses. This research contributes to the understanding of customer loyalty in retail and provides practical guidance for retailers to improve customer relationships and refine product offerings.
